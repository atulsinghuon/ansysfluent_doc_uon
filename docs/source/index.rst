========================================

ANSYS Fluent is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software application that
is part of the ANSYS suite. It is widely recognized for its user-friendly graphical
interface, versatile simulation capabilities, and advanced features. With support
for both 2D and 3D simulations, parallel processing, and scripting in Python,
Fluent offers a comprehensive solution for simulating fluid flow and heat
transfer in various engineering applications. Its strength lies in robust meshing,
extensive physics models, and specialized modules for applications like
combustion and multiphase flow.
